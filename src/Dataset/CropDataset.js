          "Panama Disease, caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense, is one of the most destructive diseases in banana cultivation. This soil-borne fungus infects banana plants, primarily affecting Cavendish varieties. The disease leads to wilting, yellowing of leaves, and the eventual death of the plant. It is most commonly found in tropical regions and is difficult to control due to its persistence in the soil.",
